# Weather_App

This project aims to create a web application by using React.js, Node.js, Koa, Koa-router, Weather api, Twitter api, Sass and Flexbox. 

The project composes of two parts, front end and back end. The part of front end is used to build a beautiful interface for users and the part of back end is used to acquire data (JSON format) from multiple apis. 

Because of the security consideration, all api keys were removed from the repository. You can also check the package.json for the information of dependencies.

**Instructions**

The top part of the App demonstrates the weather which includes city name, current temperature, humidity and wind. Thanks to the help of Node.js, React.js acquires data from my back end to update those values in every a second. Because of this function, users are able to know the latest weather information. 

In the right-bottom corner, it shows the weather in next five days and on the left, you can see the latest tweet which includes the hashtage of #Sydney.
